# My Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This repository is a collection of various projects I've worked on that span different domains and technologies. 

## Projects Overview

- **XML Football Manager Tracker**: Python application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for dynamically adding player ID values to the `config.xml` file used for managing graphics faces in Football Manager.
